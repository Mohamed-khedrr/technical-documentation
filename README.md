# Technical-documentation

## Contribution
To enhance the usability of the technical documentation, we propose the following improvements:
- Add a "Copy Code" Button: Implement a button that allows users to easily copy code examples with a single click. This will simplify the process of copying code snippets, improving the overall user experience.
- Include Font Awesome Icons: Integrate Font Awesome, a popular icon toolkit, to the documentation. This will enable us to use various icons, including the copy icon for the "Copy Code" button.
- Implement Copy Functionality: Write the necessary JavaScript functionality to copy the code when the "Copy Code" button is clicked. The code snippet should be copied to the clipboard, making it convenient for   users to use the code in their projects.
